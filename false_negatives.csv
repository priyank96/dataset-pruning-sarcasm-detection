I think women should be able to join men's sports teams and vice versa. I really don't see any problem with for example having a 5 foot 3 inches slim women versus a 300 pound heavyweight boxer because i feel like women are very much equal to any man. Even much faster and stronger men. If anybody takes offense to my point then they need to reevaluate their lives as their are no man that could do anything better than a lady.,0,1

The omicron variant has decided to give us all a wonderful gift for Christmas. For that one day it has chosen to not be spread between people at all.
